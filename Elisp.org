My philosophy of use for dired is to keep open 1 or 2 dired buffers and use lots of subdirs. LOTS. For a while there I was frustrated with how unmanageable a dired buffer can become with dozens of open subdirs, which involve many branches in the directory structure.
I set the 'k' key to the following simple little function. Kill the current subdir, and jump back to that subdir's entry in the parent directory. I find navigation to be pretty quick, and it keeps the dired buffer tidy. Here it is. Tips or suggestions welcome. Works best with '-al' dired-listing-switches.

```
(defun dired-kill-and-next-subdir ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((subdir-name (dired-current-directory))
           (parent-dir  (file-name-directory (directory-file-name subdir-name)))
           (search-term (concat " " (file-basename subdir-name))))
    (dired-kill-subdir)
    (dired-goto-subdir parent-dir)
    (search-forward search-term)))
```

  "Toggle checkbox and insert a timestamp in the next line. "
  (interactive) 
  (save-excursion
    (move-end-of-line nil)    
    (org-toggle-checkbox)
    (org-update-checkbox-count)
    (insert (concat "\nFINISHED: <" (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d %a" (current-time)) ">"))    
    (indent-according-to-mode)))
